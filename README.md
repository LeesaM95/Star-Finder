# <Star-Finder>

# Description

Our motivation to build this project was to create an easily accessible website with information about stars, constellations, and other stellar objects. This project solves the problem of wanting to learn more about the stars and constellations and not-knowing where to turn. We learned a lot about APIs, branch-merges, and collaborating as a team.

# Installation

No installation is required, one needs to only access the website to use Star-Finder.

# Usage

To use Star-Finder one needs only to access the website, input the name of a star or contellation into the search bar, and press search. 

# Visuals
