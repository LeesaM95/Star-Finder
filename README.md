# STAR FINDER

# Installation
Star Finder is a search application designed to allow users the freedom to input the name of a star, constellation, galaxy, or other celestial body, and in return, receive a photo of said celestial body and a small snippet of information. As a website application, users only need to navigate to the website and search from there. 

These functions are all done through a javascript file using functions, arrays, loop functions, and two API's in order to run.


# Usage
When a user opens the page, they are able to navigate to the search bar located in the upper right had corner of the page. The user can then type in the name of a celestial body, and click the 'search' button provided. The page will then load a picture of the celestial body in question, and a small snippet of information regarding it next to the photo
